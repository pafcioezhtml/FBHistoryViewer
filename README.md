# FBHistoryViewer

A native macOS app for exploring your Facebook data export. Import your data once, then browse statistics, charts, and a chronological activity feed — all stored locally, nothing leaves your machine.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- A [Facebook data export](https://www.facebook.com/dyi) in JSON format

## Getting started

1. Request your data from Facebook: **Settings → Your Facebook information → Download your information**. Select **JSON** format and include at least: Messages, Posts, Likes and reactions, Comments.
2. Download and unzip the export.
3. Open FBHistoryViewer and point it at the unzipped folder. Import takes a minute or two depending on how much data you have.

You can import multiple exports (e.g. from different date ranges) — the app merges them and deduplicates automatically.

## Features

**Statistics**
- Overview: total counts for messages, posts, reactions, comments
- Messages: volume over time with per-conversation overlay, top conversations, average message length by year, most shared domains
- Posts: posts per year (own / wall / group), average post length, most tagged people
- Activity: comments and reactions per month, activity by hour and weekday, reaction breakdown, people you commented on and reacted to most

**Activity Feed**
- Separate browsable lists for Posts, Comments, and Likes
- Full-text search in each feed

## Building from source

Requires Xcode 16+ and [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
cd FBHistoryViewer
xcodegen
open FBHistoryViewer.xcodeproj
```

The only external dependency is [GRDB.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift), fetched automatically by Swift Package Manager.

## Data & privacy

All data is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/FBHistoryViewer/history.sqlite` on your own machine. Nothing is uploaded or shared anywhere.

## Notes

- Post type classification (own / wall post / group post) and the "people you engaged with" lists rely on English-language title strings generated by Facebook. They will not work correctly if your Facebook interface was set to another language — the underlying data is still imported correctly, only those derived analytics are affected.
- The app is ad-hoc signed. On first launch macOS Gatekeeper will block it — right-click → Open → Open to proceed.
